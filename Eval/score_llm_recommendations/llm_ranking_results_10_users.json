The Poisonwood Bible: A Novel by Barbara Kingsolver\n   Description: Nathan Price, a evangelical Baptist who in 1959 has taken his wife and four daughters on a mission to the Belgian Congo, finds that their traditions are no longer secure in this very different world. Reprint. 250,000 first printing.\n\n2. Plainsong (Vintage Contemporaries) by KENT HARUF\n   Description: NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST • NATIONAL BESTSELLER • This poignant novel weaves together the lives of a high school teacher, a pregnant teenage girl, and two elderly bachelor brothers, capturing the essence of human resilience and community across four generations. \"Resonant and meaningful . . . . A song of praise in honor of the lives it chronicles [and] a story about people's ability to adapt and redeem themselves.\" —The Washington Post Book World \"So foursquare, so delicate and lovely . . . it has the power to exalt the reader.\" —The New York Times Book Review In the small town of Holt, Colorado, a high school teacher is confronted with raising his two boys alone after their mother retreats first to the bedroom, then altogether. A teenage girl—her father long since disappeared, her mother unwilling to have her in the house—is pregnant, alone herself, with nowhere to go. And out in the country, two brothers, elderly bachelors, work the family homestead, the only world they've ever known. From these unsettled lives emerges a vision of life, and of the town and landscape that bind them together—their fates somehow overcoming the powerful circumstances of place and station, their confusion, curiosity, dignity and humor intact and resonant. As the milieu widens to embrace fully four generations, Kent Haruf displays an emotional and aesthetic authority to rival the past masters of a classic American tradition.\n\n3. Missing May (Yearling Newbery) by Cynthia Rylant\n   Description: After the death of the aunt who has raised her, 12-year-old Summer and her uncle leave their W. Va. trailer in search of the strength to go on living.\n\n4. Rain by Kirsty Gunn\n   Description: The debut of an astonishing new literary talent, Rain proves that its author, Kirsty Gunn, is already a master of her craft. Written in luminous prose and embroidered with sensuous imagery, Rain is an unforgettable novel. Twelve-year-old Janey and her younger brother, Jim spend summers at a lake with their parents. Ignored for long stretches and then called upon suddenly to mix drinks or receive drunken kisses, the children huddle together in tender, compulsive closeness. Nourished only by their devotion to one another, the two fill their neglected hours exploring the lush, dangerous landscape and protecting each other from the unpredictable moods of the dark adult world that surrounds them. A haunting, beautifully rendered story that explores the hidden dangers of childhood, Rain has established Kirsty Gunn as one of the most promising and original writers of her generation.\n\n5.

The Poisonwood Bible: A Novel by Barbara Kingsolver\n   Description: Nathan Price, a evangelical Baptist who in 1959 has taken his wife and four daughters on a mission to the Belgian Congo, finds that their traditions are no longer secure in this very different world. Reprint. 250,000 first printing.\n\n2. Plainsong (Vintage Contemporaries) by KENT HARUF\n   Description: NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST • NATIONAL BESTSELLER • This poignant novel weaves together the lives of a high school teacher, a pregnant teenage girl, and two elderly bachelor brothers, capturing the essence of human resilience and community across four generations. \"Resonant and meaningful . . . . A song of praise in honor of the lives it chronicles [and] a story about people's ability to adapt and redeem themselves.\" —The Washington Post Book World \"So foursquare, so delicate and lovely . . . it has the power to exalt the reader.\" —The New York Times Book Review In the small town of Holt, Colorado, a high school teacher is confronted with raising his two boys alone after their mother retreats first to the bedroom, then altogether. A teenage girl—her father long since disappeared, her mother unwilling to have her in the house—is pregnant, alone herself, with nowhere to go. And out in the country, two brothers, elderly bachelors, work the family homestead, the only world they've ever known. From these unsettled lives emerges a vision of life, and of the town and landscape that bind them together—their fates somehow overcoming the powerful circumstances of place and station, their confusion, curiosity, dignity and humor intact and resonant. As the milieu widens to embrace fully four generations, Kent Haruf displays an emotional and aesthetic authority to rival the past masters of a classic American tradition.\n\n3. Missing May (Yearling Newbery) by Cynthia Rylant\n   Description: After the death of the aunt who has raised her, 12-year-old Summer and her uncle leave their W. Va. trailer in search of the strength to go on living.\n\n4. Rain by Kirsty Gunn\n   Description: The debut of an astonishing new literary talent, Rain proves that its author, Kirsty Gunn, is already a master of her craft. Written in luminous prose and embroidered with sensuous imagery, Rain is an unforgettable novel. Twelve-year-old Janey and her younger brother, Jim spend summers at a lake with their parents. Ignored for long stretches and then called upon suddenly to mix drinks or receive drunken kisses, the children huddle together in tender, compulsive closeness. Nourished only by their devotion to one another, the two fill their neglected hours exploring the lush, dangerous landscape and protecting each other from the unpredictable moods of the dark adult world that surrounds them. A haunting, beautifully rendered story that explores the hidden dangers of childhood, Rain has established Kirsty Gunn as one of the most promising and original writers of her generation.\n\n5.

Convinced by a visionary young minister, they elect to quarantine themselves within the village boundaries to arrest the spread of the disease. But as death reaches into every household, faith frays. When villagers turn from prayers and herbal cures to sorcery and murderous witch-hunting, Anna must confront the deaths of family, the disintegration of her community, and the lure of a dangerous and illicit love. As she struggles to survive, a year of plague becomes, instead, annus mirabilis, a \"year of wonders.' Inspired by the true story of Eyam, a village in the rugged mountain spine of England.

Memoirs of a Geisha Uk by Arthur Golden\n   Description: 'An epic tale and a brutal evocation of a disappearing world' The Times A young peasant girl is sold as servant and apprentice to a renowned geisha house. Many years later she tells her story from a hotel in New York, opening a window into an extraordinary half-hidden world of eroticism and enchantment, exploitation and degradation and summoning up a quarter of a century of Japan's dramatic history.

Year of Wonders by Geraldine Brooks\n   Description: \"When an infected bolt of cloth carries plague from London to an isolated mountain village, a housemaid named Anna Frith emerges as an unlikely heroine and healer. Through Anna's eyes, we follow the story of the plague year, 1666, as her fellow villagers make an extraordinary choice. Convinced by a visionary young minister, they elect to quarantine themselves within the village boundaries to arrest the spread of the disease. But as death reaches into every household, faith frays. When villagers turn from prayers and herbal cures to sorcery and murderous witch-hunting, Anna must confront the deaths of family, the disintegration of her community, and the lure of a dangerous and illicit love. As she struggles to survive, a year of plague becomes, instead, annus mirabilis, a \"year of wonders.' Inspired by the true story of Eyam, a village in the rugged mountain spine of England.

Charlotte's Web (Trophy Newbery) by E. B. White\n   Description: Sixty years ago, on October 15, 1952, E.B. White's Charlotte's Web was published. It's gone on to become one of the most beloved children's books of all time. To celebrate this milestone, the renowned Newbery Medalist Kate DiCamillo has written a heartfelt and poignant tribute to the book that is itself a beautiful translation of White's own view of the world—of the joy he took in the change of seasons, in farm life, in the miracles of life and death, and, in short, the glory of everything. We are proud to include Kate DiCamillo's foreword in the 60th anniversary editions of this cherished classic. Charlotte's Web is the story of a little girl named Fern who loved a little pig named Wilbur—and of Wilbur's dear friend Charlotte A. Cavatica, a beautiful large grey spider who lived with Wilbur in the barn. With the help of Templeton, the rat who never did anything for anybody unless there was something in it for him, and by a wonderfully clever plan of her own, Charlotte saved the life of Wilbur, who by this time had grown up to quite a pig. How all this comes about is Mr. White's story. It is a story of the magic of childhood on the farm. The thousands of children who loved Stuart Little, the heroic little city mouse, will be entranced with Charlotte the spider, Wilbur the pig, and Fern, the little girl who understood their language. The forty-seven black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams have all the wonderful detail and warmhearted appeal that children love in his work. Incomparably matched to E.B. White's marvelous story, they speak to each new generation, softly and irresistibly.\n\n2. Battle Royale (Battle Royale) by Koushun Takami\n   Description: This classic yet controversial Japanese novel is available for the first time in English--a high-octane thriller about senseless youth violence that is a potent allegory of what it means to be young and survive in today's dog-eat-dog world.\n\n3. Flame Of Recca (Flame Of Recca) by Nobuyuki Anzai\n   Description: Armed with the power to control flame, Recca Hanabishi finds himself in an awkward situation when a mysterious older woman pops into his life one day. Is she good? Is she evil? What exactly does she want with the young ninja firecracker? Teenager Recca Hanabishi is always up for a good-natured tussle with his friends. That's because he's famous at school and around town for being a super ninja geek. Armed with the power to control flame, Recca suddenly finds himself in an awkward situation. On the day he pledges his undying ninja allegiance to a pretty classmate named Yanagi Sakoshita, a mysterious older woman pops into his life. Is she good? Is she evil? What exactly does she want? And what's the deal with tomboy, Fuko Kirisawa? She's got the power of wind at her command. Does she want to smash our hero to smithereens, or does she simply want to kiss him?

How all this comes about is Mr. White's story. It is a story of the magic of childhood on the farm. The thousands of children who loved Stuart Little, the heroic little city mouse, will be entranced with Charlotte the spider, Wilbur the pig, and Fern, the little girl who understood their language. The forty-seven black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams have all the wonderful detail and warmhearted appeal that children love in his work. Incomparably matched to E.B. White's marvelous story, they speak to each new generation, softly and irresistibly.\n\n2.

Visual Literacy: Writing about Art by Amy  Tucker\n   Description: Publisher Description\n\n2. Sense and Sensibility (Penguin Popular Classics) by Jane Austen\n   Description: In nineteenth-century England, two sisters are drawn into unhappy romances despite the cool judgment of one and the emotional intensity of the other.\n\n3. Dracula (Penguin Popular Classics) by Bram Stoker\n   Description: Irish author Bram Stoker introduced the character of Count Dracula and provided the basis of modern vampire fiction in his 1897 novel entitled \"Dracula.\" Written as a series of letters, newspaper clippings, diary entries, and ships' logs, the story begins with lawyer Jonathan Harker journeying to meet Dracula at his remote castle to complete a real estate transaction. Harker soon discovers that he is being held prisoner, and that Dracula has a rather disquieting nocturnal life. Touching on themes such as Victorian culture, immigration, and colonialism, among others, this timeless classic is sure to keep readers on the edge of their seats! Now available as part of the Canterbury Classics singles series, \"Dracula\" is a must-have addition to the libraries of all classic literature lovers.\n\n4. Vanity Fair (Penguin Popular Classics) by William Makepeace Thackeray\n   Description: Vanity Fair, Thackeray's panoramic, satirical saga of corruption at all levels of English society, was published in 1847 but set during the Napoleonic Wars. It chronicles the lives of two women who could not be more different: Becky Sharp, an orphan whose only resources are her vast ambitions, her native wit, and her loose morals; and her schoolmate Amelia Sedley, a typically naive Victorian heroine, the pampered daughter of a wealthy family. Becky's fluctuating fortunes eventually bring her to an affair with Amelia's dissolute husband; when he is killed at Waterloo, Amelia and her child are left penniless, while Becky and her husband Rawdon Crawley rise in the world, managing to lead a high life in London solely on the basis of their shrewdness. (The chapter entitled \"How to Live on Nothing\" is a classic.) Thackeray's subtitle, \"A Novel Without a Hero,\" is understating the case; his view of humanity in this novel is distinctly bleak and deliberately antiheroic. Critics of the time misunderstood the book, decrying it as (among other things) vicious, vile, and odious. But VANITY FAIR has endured as one of the great comic novels of all time, and a landmark in the history of realism in fiction.\n\n5. \\The Happy Prince\\\" and Other Stories (Penguin Popular Classics)\" by Oscar Wilde\n   Description: These special fairy tales, which Oscar Wilde made up for his own sons, include 'The Happy Prince', who was not as happy as he seemed; 'The Selfish Giant', who learned to love little children; 'The Star Child', who suffered bitter trials when he rejected his parents. . . . Often whimsical and sometimes sad, they all shine with poetry and magic.\n\n\nNow consider the following candidate books.

Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul by Douglas Adams (8.82% Angust) - This book matches the user's emotional preference for Anticipation (4.77%) and has no indication of Fear or Sadness.\n2. Shipwreck (Island, Book 1) by Gordon Korman (6.23% Angust) - While this book doesn't match the user's strongest preference (Ella Enchanted), it does have a hint of Disgust in its title.\n3. Oliver Twist (Great Illustrated Classics) by Charles Dickens (8.53% Angust) - Although it contains elements of Anger and Anticipation, this book also has a high level of Sadness.\n4. How to Stay Alive in the Woods : A Complete Guide to Food, Shelter, and Self-Preservation That Makes Starvation in the Wilderness Next to Impossible by Bradford Angier (6.83% Angust) - This book is highly unlikely due to its content, which seems more geared towards entertainment than emotional resonance.\n5. Island of the Blue Dolphins (Laurel Leaf Books) by Scott O'Dell (8.34% Angust) - While it matches the user's preference for Joy (24.43%), this book also contains elements that could be considered Angry or Disgusted due to its historical context and portrayal of life in a wilderness environment.\n\nRank: 1, 2, 5, 3"

Ashes to Ashes: The Dragon's Flame (Blackstone Chronicles, Part 3) by John Saul - While not directly related to dark angels or spirituality, this book matches the user's sense of mystery and fantasy found in \"The Watcher\".\n3. Remember Me #1 (reissue) by Christopher Pike - This re-release aligns with the user's fondness for Christopher Pike's previous work, particularly in themes of human emotion and relationships.\n4. The Incredible Worlds Of Wally Mcdoogle: #18 My Life As A Busted-up Basketball Backboard by Bill Myers - Although this book seems to be a light-hearted comedy, its themes of failure and self-acceptance resonate with the user's negative emotions towards certain topics.\n5. Wild Mind: Living the Writer's Life by Natalie Goldberg - This book aligns with the user's appreciation for \"Master of Murder\" and their interest in creative writing.\n6. Weekend (Point) by Christopher Pike - While this book is a collection, its focus on short stories might not directly match the user's preferences, which are more aligned with novels.\n7. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl - Although a classic and entertaining choice, it doesn't align as closely with the user's emotional profile and reading history.\n8. Heaven by V.C. Andrews - The themes of death, decay, and tragedy might be off-putting to this user based on their negative emotions towards certain topics.\n9. Flowers in Attic (Dollanger Saga) by V.C. Andrews - This book appears to be a heavy and macabre choice, which doesn't align with the user's preferences for lighter themes.\n10. Master of Murder by Christopher Pike - The dark and violent nature of this book might not match the user's preferred tone.\n\nNote that some books may have elements of multiple categories, but based on their titles alone, I've assigned them to the one category that best fits their overall theme or tone."

Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels (Paperback)) by Isaac Asimov (anticipation)\n8. Odyssey by Homer (anticipation, but not as much as the other candidates with this emotion)\n9. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Bantam Classics) by Lewis Carroll (surprise could potentially appeal to the user, but it's less likely compared to the others)\n10. Dancing at Midnight by Julia Quinn (joy is not a prominent emotion in this user's profile)"

Time of the Twins (Dragonlance Legends, Vol. 1) by Margaret Weis - Similar reasoning as above for Dragons of Autumn Twilight.\n4. Mossflower (Redwall, Book 2) by Brian Jacques - This book could also cater to the user's preference for fantastical elements, as suggested by the \"Redwall\" series title.\n5. Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Book 3) by Margaret Weis - Continuing with the dragon theme from the previous books.\n6. Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants: The Fourth Epic Novel (Captain Underpants (Paperback)) by Dav Pilkey - While not directly related to any of the user's stated preferences, humor can often evoke joy in readers, which is a significant emotion for this user.\n7. Tales of Uncle Trapspringer (Dragonlance) by Dixie Lee McKeone - Similar reasoning as with other Dragonlance books.\n8. Dragons of Winter Night (Dragonlance: Dragonlance Chronicles) by Margaret Weis - Continuing the dragon theme once more.\n9. The Twinkie Squad by Gordon Korman - This book seems less likely to align with the user's preferences based on its title and content, which appears to be humor for a younger audience.\n10. Where the Boys Are by John Hall - This book does not seem to directly relate to any of the user's stated preferences or emotional profile."

Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones - The high level of Anticipation (8.82%) in this title suggests that this book might resonate with the user.\n2. Dark Rider by IRIS JOHANSEN - The strong Emotion Profile indicates a preference for thrilling and potentially dark stories, making Dark Rider a likely match.\n3. Sabriel (adult edition) (The Abhorsen Trilogy) by Garth Nix - The high Anticipation level and the presence of Fantasy elements in this title suggest that Sabriel might appeal to the user's emotional profile.\n4. Monster Blood II (Goosebumps, No 18) by R. L. Stine - The high level of Fear (24.68%) in this title indicates a strong potential match for the user's preference.\n5. Pooh Goes Visiting (A Winnie-the-Pooh Story Book) by A. A. Milne - While this book is not as intense as the other recommendations, its whimsical tone and content might still resonate with the user.\n6. The Magician's Nephew (rack) (Narnia) by C. S. Lewis - Although this title is a classic, its high Sadness level (13.52%) might make it less appealing to this user.\n7. Samantha Saves the Day: A Summer Story (American Girls Collection) by Valerie Tripp - The high Joy level in this title suggests that it might not be a good fit for the user's emotional profile.\n8. Lost and Found (Remnants, Book 10) by K. A. Applegate - While the book is not extremely intense, its Sadness level (13.52%) might make it less appealing to this user.\n9. The Hobbit (Young Adult edition, Sis cover) by J. R. R. Tolkien - Although the book has a high Joy level (10.89%), its overall emotional profile might be off-putting to the user due to the fantasy setting and themes.\n10. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (The Chronicles of Narnia, Book 2) by C. S.

The Hobbit : The Enchanting Prelude to The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. TOLKIEN - This book has elements of joy and adventure that align with the user's preference for joy (29.22%).\n\n2. Summer Sisters by JUDY BLUME - This book may evoke feelings of joy and anticipation, which are in line with the user's preferences.\n\n3. Encyclopedia Brown Sets the Pace (Encyclopedia Brown (Paperback)) by Donald J. Sobol - This book could potentially elicit feelings of anticipation and joy, aligning with the user's preferences.\n\n4. A Scientific Romance by Ronald Wright - This book might offer a blend of various emotions, including joy, fear, and surprise, which are partially aligned with the user's profile.\n\n5. Like a Hole in the Head by Jen Banbury - While this book could evoke feelings of sadness (which is part of the user's profile), it seems less likely to align with the user's preference for joy as the primary emotion.\n\n6. The Vile Village (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 7) by Lemony Snicket - This book belongs to the series that the user has already read and rated highly, but it may not align as well with the user's current emotional preferences.\n\n7. The Hostile Hospital (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 8) by Lemony Snicket - Similar reasoning applies here, as this is another book from the series that the user has already read and rated highly.\n\n8.

Life Lessons: Book Of I Corinthians (Inspirational Bible Study Series) by Max Lucado - Given the user's preference for genres outside of inspirational or religious books, this book is least likely to be a good match."

The Holographic Dollhouse: A Novel (Merrywell Trilogy, Part 2) by Charlotte Lawrence\n\nThis book aligns with the user's preference for novels that contain a sense of anticipation and excitement, given its part in the Merrywell Trilogy series. It also shares some similarities with \"Neverwhere\" and \"The Best Poems Ever\", which were rated highly by the user.\n\n2. Anne of Windy Poplars (Anne of Green Gables Novels (Paperback)) by L.M. Montgomery\n\nThis book fits within the user's preference for books that evoke a sense of nostalgia, given its connection to the classic novel \"Anne of Green Gables\". It also shares some similarities with other highly-rated books such as \"Unless\" and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".\n\n3. Together by Linda L. Miller\n\nThis book aligns with the user's preference for books that deal with themes of trust and friendship, given its focus on relationships between characters. However, it does not match any other preferences or emotional profiles.\n\n4. Anne of Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables Novels (Paperback)) by L.M.

Anne of Green Gables (Anne of Green Gables Novels (Paperback)) by L.M. Montgomery\n\nThis book is a direct match to the user's favorite novel, \"Anne of Green Gables\".

Montgomery\n\nThis book shares some similarities with \"Anne of Green Gables\" in terms of its nostalgic tone and focus on childhood friendships, but may not align as strongly with the user's preferences due to its focus on dreams and imagination rather than real-life experiences.\n\n7. The Best Poems Ever: A Collection of Poetry's Greatest Voices (Scholastic Classics) by Edric S.

Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand (ranked as a surprise match)\n4. Lord of the Silent: A Novel of Suspense by Elizabeth Peters (ranked as a joy match)\n\nThese books align with the user's emotional preferences, such as anger and disgust being low, fear and sadness being moderate, and trust being high. The Chosen is an excellent match for this user due to its themes of identity, morality, and the struggle between good and evil, which are consistent with their Anticipation preference. A Lesson Before Dying and Atlas Shrugged also share elements of social justice, morality, and the human condition, making them relevant to the user's emotions."

Dalva (Contemporary Classics (Washington Square Press)) by Jim Harrison - As this book deals with themes of family, love, and loss, which align well with the user's Sadness preference.\n2. Silent Mobius (Vol 1) by Kia Asamiya - This manga is set in a world where magic has disappeared, which could resonate with the user's Disgust preference for unfamiliar or disturbing content.\n3. Neon Genesis Evangelion: Special Collector's Edition, Vol. 4 by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto - While this book deals with themes of trauma and existentialism, its focus on a sci-fi concept might be more appealing to the user's Surprise preference.\n4. Ben's in Love (Making Out , No 4) by Katherine Applegate - This novel is a coming-of-age story that explores complex relationships and family dynamics, which aligns well with the user's Joy preference.\n5. Oracle (Fushigi Yugi: The Mysterious Play, Vol. 2) by Yu Watase - Although this book deals with themes of magic and mysticism, its focus on mystery and adventure might be more appealing to the user's Surprise preference.\n6. Pen Pals by Olivia Goldsmith - This novel is a light-hearted coming-of-age story that explores relationships and identity, which aligns somewhat well with the user's Joy preference.\n7. William Faulkner : Novels 1930-1935 : As I Lay Dying, Sanctuary, Light in August, Pylon (Library of America) by William Faulkner - This book deals with complex themes of family, trauma, and social commentary, which might not align as well with the user's preferences.\n8. Priestess (Fushigi Yugi: The Mysterious Play, Vol. 1) by Yu Watase - Similar to Oracle, this book explores mystery and adventure, but its focus on fantasy might be less appealing to the user's Disgust preference.\n9. Cheaper by the Dozen by Frank B., Jr Gilbreth - This family comedy is lighthearted and entertaining, which might not align as well with the user's preferences for more serious or complex themes.\n10. Bandit (Fushigi Yugi: The Mysterious Play, Vol. 4) by Yu Watase - As mentioned earlier, this book deals with mystery and adventure, but its focus on fantasy might be less appealing to the user's Disgust preference.\n\nNote that these rankings are based on a subjective interpretation of the user's emotional profile and inferred reading preferences, and may not reflect their actual preferences."

Shades of Gray (Paranormal Romance) by Amanda Ashley - This romance novel matches the user's emotional profile, featuring a mix of suspenseful and thrilling elements.\n3. Roots by Alex Haley - While not strictly a fantasy or paranormal romance, this historical novel aligns with the user's appreciation for stories about people from different backgrounds and cultures.\n4. Travel the Great States by School Zone Publishing - This non-fiction book doesn't match any of the user's preferences, but it does provide information on travel destinations.\n5. The Predator (Animorphs) by K. A. Applegate - This science fiction novel features a young adult protagonist in a post-apocalyptic world, which might not align with the user's preference for more mature themes and fantasy novels.\n6. On the Edge : Stories at the Brink by Lois Duncan - This young adult horror novel doesn't match any of the user's preferences, featuring a dark and suspenseful tone.\n7. Summer of the Dancing Horse by Eth Clifford - This children's book features a unique plot and illustrations, which might not align with the user's preference for more mature themes and fantasy novels.\n8. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by Stephen King - While an excellent author, this novel doesn't match any of the user's preferences, featuring a darker tone and more horror elements than the user seems to prefer.\n9. Rest in Pieces (Mrs. Murphy Mysteries) by Rita Mae Brown - This mystery novel features a detective with a troubled past, which might not align with the user's preference for more complex characters and themes.\n10. The Witching Hour (Lives of the Mayfair Witches) by Anne Rice - While an excellent author, this Gothic fantasy novel doesn't match any of the user's preferences, featuring mature themes and supernatural elements that might be too intense.\n\nNote: These rankings are based on my analysis of the emotional profile and inferred reading preferences, but individual tastes may vary."

Thoroughbred #06 Wonder's Yearling (Thoroughbred) by Joanna Campbell - This book might not align as well with the user's emotional profile due to its focus on horses and sports rather than emotions or relationships.\n9. IGCSE Business Studies by Karen Borrington - Given that this is a textbook focused on business studies, it is less likely to match the user's emotional preferences.\n10. The Children's Bible by J.

Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad, Book 4) by David Eddings - This title aligns with the user's high anticipation score and their interest in fantasy novels.\n2. Candy Tots: Unique Crochet for Babies & Toddlers by Candi Jensen - Although not typically considered a \"book\" type, this title fits within the emotional profile and is an unusual yet interesting product that might pique the user's curiosity.\n3. Guns of Navarone by Alistair MacLean - This novel aligns with the user's high anger score, and its themes of danger and suspense might appeal to their adventurous side.\n4. The Truth About Stacey (Baby-Sitters Club, 3) by Ann M. Martin - This title fits within the user's sentimental nature, as it relates to a childhood memory (the Baby-Sitters Club series).\n5. Take a Thief by Mercedes Lackey - Although this book aligns with the user's interest in fantasy and adventure, its plot is not particularly emotional or personal.\n6. Heir to the Empire (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 1) by Timothy Zahn - This title does not match any of the user's preferences, as it seems more focused on science fiction rather than their stated interest in fantasy novels.\n\nNote that some books may have multiple emotional or preference aspects that align with or contradict this ranking."

Rats (Rats) by Paul Zindel - This book may resonate with the user due to its focus on characters dealing with complex emotions and situations, aligning with the user's preference for stories that evoke a mix of fear and joy.\n2. I Was a Teenage Fairy (Ageless Books) by Francesca Lia Block - Given the user's high rating for another book by the same author, this title might also be appealing.\n3. Princess in Love (The Princess Diaries, Vol. 3) by Meg Cabot - The user has enjoyed volumes from this series before, and it aligns with their preference for books that evoke feelings of joy and trust.\n4. Lamb : The Gospel According to Biff, Christ’s Childhood Pal by Christopher Moore - This book may appeal to the user due to its humorous tone, which might trigger feelings of joy and surprise.\n5. Violet & Claire by Francesca Lia Block - Although this book is by the same author as some books the user highly rated, it might not be as strong a match due to potentially heavier themes.\n6. Ophelia Speaks : Adolescent Girls Write About Their Search for Self by Sara Shandler - This book may address themes that resonate with the user's emotional profile but could evoke feelings of sadness or anger as well.\n7. Twin of Ice by Jude Deveraux - This title might not be a good fit based on the user's emotional profile and preferences, as it is a romance novel which may not align with their stated preferences.\n8. Azfa Hanani by Halis Azhan Mohd. Hanafiah - This book is likely to be outside the user's preferred genres or themes.\n9. The Commodore (O'Brian, Patrick, Aubrey/Maturin Novels, 17.) by Patrick O'Brian - This book may not appeal to the user due to its historical and nautical focus, which might be too far from their preferred genres.\n10.

    "llm_output": "Based on the user's preferences and emotional profile, here is a ranked list of candidate books from most likely to least likely to be recommended:\n\n1. Dragons of Winter Night (Dragonlance: Dragonlance Chronicles) by Margaret Weis - This book is a continuation of the Dragonlance series which the user has shown interest in with \"Dragons of Autumn Twilight\". The presence of fantasy elements may also cater to the user's high anticipation level.\n\n2. The Wizardwar (Forgotten Realms: Counselors & Kings, Book 3) by Elaine Cunningham - Given that the user has shown interest in \"The Magehound\" from the Forgotten Realms series, this book might also be of interest due to its connection to the same series.\n\n3. Little House on the Prairie (Little House On the Prairie (little house)) by Laura Ingalls Wilder - This book could potentially cater to the user's high joy level, as it is a heartwarming and nostalgic tale.\n\n4. Tolliver by Paul A. Hawkins - While not part of a series, this title seems to have elements that may appeal to readers who enjoy fantasy or adventure, which aligns with the user's preference for anticipation.\n\n5. Son of a Wanted Man by LOUIS L'AMOUR - The presence of action and adventure could potentially cater to the user's high joy level, but without specific information about the genre or setting, it is less certain compared to the other titles on this list.\n\n6. Underwater Animals (Fun Facts for Curious Kids) by Annabelle Donati - This book may not be a good fit given the adult-oriented preferences of the user and lack of related themes in their reading history.\n\n7. Teach Yourself Beginner's Japanese Script by Helen Gilhooly - The user has shown no interest in learning Japanese, so this book is less likely to be a good match.\n\n8. Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Book 3) by Margaret Weis - While the user did enjoy \"Dragons of Autumn Twilight\", recommending books out of sequence might confuse or disappoint them, making this book less likely to be recommended.\n\n9. Communion : A True Story by Whitley Strieber - The themes of fear and the unknown could potentially cater to the user's high fear level, but without more information about their specific interests within these genres, it is less certain compared to the other titles on this list.\n\n10. Getting Over It by Anna Maxted - The title suggests self-help or personal development, which does not align with any of the user's expressed preferences in their reading history."
